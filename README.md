# ðŸ§  Learning Machine Learning

This repository contains step-by-step notebooks designed to deepen my understanding of the core pillars of Machine Learning.

Each notebook focuses on a key concept, implementing it from first principles when possible, and comparing it to industry-standard libraries like `scikit-learn`.

## ðŸ“š Topics covered (in progress)

- [x] PCA from scratch (Iris dataset)
- [ ] Linear regression from scratch
- [ ] Probability and basic statistics
- [ ] Gradient descent and optimization
- [ ] Regularization techniques (L1, L2)
- [ ] Logistic regression
- [ ] Feature scaling and preprocessing

## ðŸš€ Goal

My goal is to build strong foundations in machine learning â€” from algebra and statistics to model implementation â€” with the aim of working professionally in ML within a year.

## ðŸ›  Tools

- Python
- NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for comparison only)
- Google Colab
